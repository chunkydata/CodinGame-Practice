# https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/blowing-fuse
# 
# You are going to write a program to predict whether a specific usage pattern of electrical appliances will cause the main fuse to blow.
# 
# You have three pieces of data.
# 1. There are n appliances in a room, each of them has an electrical current consumption value.
# 2. A usage pattern. You will click the power buttons of a list of appliances in a sequence, at most m clicks. Each click on a button will toggle the power status, which means when the power is OFF, a click will turn it ON. Clicking it again will turn it OFF.
# 3. The capacity of the main fuse c in amperes [A].
# 
# The fuse will be blown if the sum of the consumed current of turned-on devices at some point exceeds the capacity of the main fuse c.
# 
# At the beginning, all appliances are OFF.
