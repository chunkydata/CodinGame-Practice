# 
# The Goal:
#     
# Batman will look for the hostages on a given building by jumping from one window to another using his grapnel gun.
# Batman's goal is to jump to the window where the hostages are located in order to disarm the bombs.
# Unfortunately he has a limited number of jumps before the bombs go off...
# 
# Rules:
#     
# Before each jump, the heat-signature device will provide Batman with the direction of the bombs
# based on Batman current position:
# 
# U (Up)
# UR (Up-Right)
# R (Right)
# DR (Down-Right)
# D (Down)
# DL (Down-Left)
# L (Left)
# UL (Up-Left)
# 
# 
# Your mission is to program the device so that it indicates the location of the next window
# Batman should jump to in order to reach the bombs' room as soon as possible.
# 
# Buildings are represented as a rectangular array of windows, the window in the top left corner of the building
# is at index (0,0).
