# 
# Goal:
# 
# You enter a section of road and you plan to rest entirely on your cruise control to cross the area without having to stop or slow down.
# 
# The goal is to find the maximum speed (off speeding) that will allow you to cross all the traffic lights to green.
# 
# Warning: You can not cross a traffic light the second it turns red !
# 
# Your vehicle enters the zone directly at the speed programmed on the cruise control which ensures that it does not change anymore.
# 
# 
# Input:
#     
# Line 1: An integer speed for the maximum speed allowed on the portion of the road (in km / h).
# 
# Line 2: An integer lightCount for the number of traffic lights on the road.
# 
# lightCount next lines:
# - An integer distance representing the distance of the traffic light from the starting point (in meters).
# - An integer duration representing the duration of the traffic light on each color.
# 
# A traffic light alternates a period of duration seconds in green and then duration seconds in red.
# All traffic lights turn green at the same time as you enter the area.
# 
# 
# Output:
#     
# Line 1: The integer speed (km / h) as high as possible that cross all the green lights without committing speeding.
# 
# 
# Constraints:
#     
# 1 ≤ speed ≤ 200
# 1 ≤ lightCount ≤ 9999
# 1 ≤ distance ≤ 99999
# 1 ≤ duration ≤ 9999
